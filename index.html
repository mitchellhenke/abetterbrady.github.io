    <h1>A Better Brady Street</h1>
    <p>Brady Street is not only a major business center in Milwaukee, it is the core of a lively and historic neighborhood. Residents and visitors alike deserve a safe, inclusive, and comfortable place to shop, dine, and enjoy life. Brady Street has struggled with dangerous driving for decades. Reckless driving on Brady has caused countless <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2023/06/07/man-struck-by-vehicle-on-brady-street-is-doing-much-better/70300305007/">injuries</a> and <a href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/milwaukee-police-search-for-suspect-vehicle-driver-involved-in-deadly-hit-and-run-on-brady-street">several</a> <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2022/09/29/94-year-old-woman-dies-after-being-hit-car-near-prospect-avenue/8131830001/">deaths</a>. It also makes the street less comfortable and prevents businesses and residents alike from fully enjoying their neighborhood. By focusing on safety and neighborhood access over car throughput and speed, we can create a more inclusive environment with greater independence and freedom for everyone, especially kids and our most vulnerable neighbors.</p>

    <h2>What is Being Proposed?</h2>
    <p>The <a href='https://bradystreet.org/'>Brady Street Business Improvement District</a> (BID), City of Milwaukee, The <a href="https://tkwa.com">Kubala Washatko Architects (TKWA)</a> and <a href="https://graef-usa.com">GRAEF</a> are studying options to refocus Brady Street's design to better serve neighbors and businesses in the area rather than acting primarily as a through street for people driving to other areas of the city. The <a href='https://bradystreet.org/pedestrian-first-study/'>initial report</a> includes four options, two of which consider closing part of Brady Street to private vehicles and maintaining access for buses and deliveries. The project has a few key goals:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Brady Street should act as a neighborhood hub, a place where everyone can safely and comfortably come together as neighbors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brady Street should support local businesses that draw customers from within the neighborhood and across the region.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brady Street should be a comfortable and safe place for people of all ages and abilities to bike, walk, and explore the neighborhood businesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Neighbors must be able to safely enter and leave their homes by car, bike, bus, or walking.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How Can I Help?</h2>
    <p>There are several ways to get involved and make your voice heard.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Review the <a href="https://bradystreet.org/pedestrian-first-study/">proposed designs</a> - we think #4 is best for people!</a></li>
      <li>Message the Brady St BID (end of the above page has a feedback form) - they really went above and beyond with the design options and we want them to know it's appreciated. Tell them you like #4 and what your favorite place to hang out is and why you'll do it more if it's safer. Have kids and live nearby? Make sure you tell them about how unsafe it feels for children now, and what a big change #4 would be!</li>
      <li>Email Alderperson Brostoff, and the Mayor. Tell them a brief personal reason why you'd visit or enjoy Brady St more if it was safer for pedestrians when car traffic is reduced. If you live nearby, let them know that you're OK with a slight inconvenience to yourself or other drivers if it means people on Brady are safer. Don't overthink it, just let them know you like it. <code>Jonathan.Brostoff@milwaukee.gov</code> and <code>mayor@milwaukee.gov</code></li>
      <li>Tell a friend to do the same, or share your thoughts on social media. Wealthy land owners are rumored to be against this, and everyone needs to know that the people who live and work here support it.</li>
      <li>Attend our upcoming organizing meeting to meet other neighbors and friends who want to see the project succeed. Bring someone with!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>How will side street traffic be impacted by closing Brady Street?</h3>
    <p>While Brady Street does support business traffic, it also frequently acts as a through-street for trips that create congestion and donâ€™t add value to the community. Most cut-through trips are better served by Ogden Avenue or North Avenue, which both have sufficient capacity to accommodate current Brady Street traffic.</p>
    <p>The City of Milwaukee's <a href='https://city.milwaukee.gov/dpw/infrastructure/Neighborhood-Traffic-Management'>Neighborhood Traffic Management Program</a> also offers subsidized traffic-calming improvements on residential streets which can be installed independently of any changes to Brady Street.</p>

    <h3>How will businesses get deliveries?</h3>
    <p>Street access may be opened for delivery vehicles prior to peak business hours and any design choices will not restrict deliveries on weekends.</p>

    <h3>Will my bus route be impacted by closures?</h3>
    <p>All bus routes will continue to operate on Brady Street. The Green Line bus, which connects Bayshore, the airport, and tons of key hubs in between, will remain open going through Brady. Reducing congestion on Brady Street will improve bus service on this important corridor.</p>

    <h3>Will emergency access be limited?</h3>
    <p>Emergency vehicles will maintain access to Brady Street. Reducing vehicle congestion on the street makes for for more reliable emergency vehicle service.</p>

    <h3>Where will people park their cars?</h3>
    <p>Brady Street contains 66 metered parking stalls and 12 loading stalls between Humboldt to Farwell. Loading stall access for businesses will be maintained.</p>
    <p>Existing off-street public parking is currently underutilized. The municipal lot at 1720 N Arlington Place has 48 parking stalls, and is conveniently connects to Arlington. Nearby street parking allows for easy handicapped access.
    <p>Design considerations will need to be taken to allow continued access to existing private surface lots.</p>
    <p>Additionally, a new parking garage with public access is planned on Farwell near Brady Street, and drivers from the east can be guided to park there.</p>

    <h3>I've heard of pedestrianization efforts that fail, how will this be different?</h3>
    <p>One that failed was Mitchell Street, which started by removing many of the businesses and destinations that made it worth visiting in the first place. With those gone, the replacement couldn't attract the people back. Brady Street is simply making the street safer for people to visit. By making it safer, it will be more appealing to new and more diverse visitors as well.</p>
    <p>Additionally, plans are being considered to do some short-term trials and solicit feedback prior to a permanent implementation.</p>
